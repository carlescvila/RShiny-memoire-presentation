# Assessing the effects of unconventional monetary policy in the Eurosystem during the covid19 crisis
In this RShiny App you will find the presentation I used for my final degree project. Therefore, the contents that may appear in the App are deeply 
discussed in the original paper. In the first page, you will find an introduction to Unconventional Monetary Policies. In the second page, the methodology
is explained using equations. Finally, I apply the methodology on the database I obtained from the ECB website. I also show the results and give conclusions.
I used EViews in this part.
